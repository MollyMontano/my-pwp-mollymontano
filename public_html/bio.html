                <p>Mu Reyes Wiesel, who uses the working artist name MuKha, is a Brooklyn and Hawaii-based
                    painter, photographer and multi-media artist. As a painter and photographer not limited to work
                    in the studio, she collaborates with musicians, composers and dancers in projects ranging from
                    improvisational performances onstage to producing multi-media events involving video and
                    musical presentations.</p>
                <p>
                    The artist name MuKha comes from the Sanskrit word for “face.” Following the intent of many
                    unnamed artists from indigenous cultures, Mu is guided by a host of influences, both external
                    and internal, from nature and happenstance, feeling more like a co-creator of her works rather
                    than an individual producing art that bears her signature. An ongoing project “Angsudden Song
                    Cycle” with multi-instrumentalist Mike McGinnis produced an LP album based on her paintings
                    and poems, and currently reincarnating into a dance drama by Davalois Fearon Dance.</p>
                <p>
                    Born in the Philippines in 1961 and raised in San Francisco from 1970, Mu moved to New York in 1989.
                    While working her career as a journalist and editor in New York City, she continued to develop her art.
                    She studied briefly at the Art Students League and is mostly self-trained. She currently divides her time
                    between Brooklyn, NY and Hanalei Bay, Kauai. MuKha has exhibited her works in the U.S., Europe, and
                    Asia as a visual artist navigating the borderless world of 21 st century art.
